# Pydantic Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that introduces and explores **Pydantic**, a powerful Python library for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.

## What is Pydantic?

**Pydantic** is a data validation and parsing library that leverages Python's type hints to define data models. It ensures the integrity and correctness of data by validating it automatically against specified types.

### Why Use Pydantic?

- Automatic data validation based on Python type hints
- Clear error messages and debugging tools
- Built-in support for complex/nested data structures
- Ideal for building fast, robust APIs (e.g., with FastAPI)
- Great for working with configuration files or external data sources

## What's Inside the Notebook?

The notebook walks through several key concepts:

1. **The Problem with Untyped Python Functions**:

   - Demonstrates how incorrect data types can break logic.
   - Shows how traditional methods of validation are verbose and not scalable.
2. **Improved Validation Using Type Hints**:

   - Introduces type hinting (`name: str, age: int`) and its limitations in runtime validation.
3. **The Power of Pydantic**:

   - Introduces Pydantic models.
   - Shows how to validate data and catch errors automatically.
   - Examples include real-world-like patient data modeling.
4. **Error Handling and Messaging**:

   - How Pydantic clearly reports what's wrong with incoming data.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
